        <h1>Funeral CRM</h1>
        <p>
          A specialized CRM for funeral homes, inspired by a “pizza tracker”
          experience: clients move through clear stages from first contact to
          cremation. Built to replace fragmented tools with one focused workflow.

          Built alongside my work with Funeral Live; intended to be sold directly
          to partner funeral homes. Early stage (no hard metrics yet), but the UX
          and domain fit are the differentiators.
